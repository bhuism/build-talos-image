## Scripts for building a talos image for the cm4

A couple of scripts needed for build a talos image, mainly for create custom images and trying out patched for u-boot or the kernel.

It is current set up for to build arm64 architecture images from a amd64 host, so make sure you do a:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

1) Run a registry

    first we run a registry images are pushed to this registry and the talos image will be build using our custom containers.

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
    ```

2) Build and push a u-boot image

    `Here u-boot next branch is used, talos obviously uses a u-boot release.

    ```bash
    cd u-boot
    ./doall
    ```

    When succesfull you should see a 
    ```"PUT /v2/ubootbash/manifests/latest HTTP/1.1"```
    call to your docker registry, takes about a minute on my machine, all good.

3) Build and push a kernel image

    Currently the doall script applies [this](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/patch/20230623144100.34196-3-james.quinlan@broadcom.com/) patch to mitigate [this](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217276) issue.

    ```bash
    cd pkgs
    ./doall
    ```

    get a lot of coffee.

    When succesfull you should see a ```"PUT /v2/rsmitty/kernel/manifests/v1.5.0-9-g7f9d6eb-dirty HTTP/1.1"``` in your registry log.

4) Build a talos image

    The Dockerfile is patched so it uses the u-boot and kernel images.

    ```bash
    cd talos
    ./doall
    ```

    get some coffee.
